# Developer Log: NearStarXR

## 2025-10-23
*   **Project Initialization:** Created the local Git repository and the remote GitHub repository.
*   **Documentation:** Established the core project documentation structure (`README.md`, `PRD.md`, `MVP.md`, `GDD.md`, `TASKS.md`, `DEVLOG.md`).
*   **Foundation:** Populated all documentation with initial vision, requirements, MVP scope, and tasks. The project now has a clear roadmap.
*   **Next Up:** Begin backend development by creating the star data files and the Flask server.

## 2025-10-23 (Evening Session)
*   **Feature Complete MVP:** Iterated rapidly on visuals and controls to achieve a polished MVP state.
*   **Aesthetic Polish:** Implemented a two-sphere model for stars (core + halo) and fine-tuned a vibrant, aesthetic color palette to make spectral types easily distinguishable.
*   **Advanced Controls:** Developed a professional control scheme:
    *   Starts with a slow, 1-minute auto-orbit around the Sun.
    *   Single-click toggles auto-orbit.
    *   Click-and-drag provides smooth manual orbit control.
    *   Shift-drag allows the user to look around.
    *   WASD and mouse-wheel zoom are fully functional.
*   **Sun as Anchor:** Restored the Sun to the scene's center (`0,0,0`) to act as a visual and navigational anchor.
*   **Data Expansion:** Increased the star dataset from the initial ~15 to the nearest 50 stars.
*   **Documentation:** Updated the `README.md` with the new control scheme and created a `ROADMAP.md` to capture future vision.
*   **Next Up:** Local testing is complete. The project is ready for containerization with Docker and deployment to Google Cloud Run.
