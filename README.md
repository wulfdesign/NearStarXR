# NearStarXR

An interactive and immersive WebXR application that visualizes the nearest stars to our solar system. This project allows users to explore our stellar neighborhood in 3D, either on a standard web browser or in a virtual reality headset.

This project is the latest iteration of a personal passion for stellar cartography that has spanned decades. It represents a modern approach to visualizing our stellar neighborhood, leveraging AI-assisted development workflows (with Gemini CLI) and immersive technologies like WebXR to create a more engaging and accessible experience.

### Technical Overview

The backend is a Python server that processes astronomical data into XYZ coordinates, which is then served to a frontend built with A-Frame. The entire application is containerized with Docker and designed for easy deployment on Google Cloud Run.

### Project Context

This project was created as an entry for the **Seattle AI Festival** and the **Chroma Awards 2025** in the Simulation / Sandbox and Experimental / Open categories.
